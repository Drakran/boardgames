# boardgames
By Terry Wang

## CLONE BOARDGAMES TO YOUR COMPUTER
1. Click the green clone or download button
2. Copy the stuff by clicking that thing on the right
3. Open terminal/console on your computer
4. `cd` into your eclipse workspace folder (for 201)
5. to put boardgames folder type this in the console

 `git clone <the stuff you copied with no angle brackets yo>`

6. Yay you cloned the stuff now if you push, it will be uploaded on github :D
7. Make sure to always **`git pull`** before every time you code to get all the latest updates on the code
 
## Switching Branches
***DO NOT MODIFY THE MASTER BRANCH OR TERRY WILL KICK YOU FROM THE GITHUB***

I’ve made 2 branches (originating from master or main branch) on github: 
front-end and back-end (DO NOT FIGHT ME ON THE DASHES IT IS THE CORRECT NAMING CONVENTION)

Before you code, ***(don’t forget to git pull !!!!)*** make sure you are in the correct branch. 

To see which branch you’re in, type
`git status`

It should say something like 
`Your branch is up to date with 'origin/<branch name>'`

To switch branches, type
`git checkout <name of branch without the angle brackets>`

## Pull Requests
If you wish to merge your branch into master, you need to create a pull request and get approval from 2 other people.
